Ensure that you have a new folder in your repository called .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE. This folder will contain your new user story template named user-story.md.
Evidence
Take a screenshot of the user-story.md template and save the screenshot as planning-storytemplate-done.jpg (or planning-storytemplate-done.png).
Exercise 4: Assemble Your Product Backlog
In this exercise, you will create user stories based on the customer accounts microservice for the e-commerce capstone project. The accounts service will have basic customer information like names and addresses.

Create seven user stories in your GitHub kanban board, one for each of the following steps of your project:

Set up the development environment
Read an account from the service
Update an account in the service
Delete an account from the service
List all accounts in the service
Containerize your microservice using Docker
Deploy your Docker image to Kubernetes
Ensure that all your stories are listed in the New Issues pipeline.

Take a screenshot of your kanban board and save the screenshot as planning-userstories-done.jpg (or planning-userstories-done.png).

Exercise 5: Triage New Issues
In this exercise, you will begin to conduct Backlog Refinement by inspecting the issues in the New Issues pipeline and moving them to the Product Backlog or Icebox depending on when you plan to work on them. Containerizing with Docker and deploying to Kubernetes is something you will do a few sprints from now, so it is not immediately important.

Steps to complete
Determine which user stories you will work on immediately and move them from the New Issues pipeline to the Product Backlog pipeline.

Move the remaining stories from New Issues into the Ice box as you will work on them later.

Five stories will be implemented now, and two will be implemented later.

Exercise 6: Refine Your Product Backlog
In this exercise, you will follow the steps of conducting a backlog refinement meeting. You will be the product owner, getting the product backlog ready for your next sprint planning meeting. The goal of this preparation is to make all your stories sprint ready.

Steps to complete
Make sure that all the stories in the Product Backlog have sufficient details to be considered “sprint ready.” Pay special attention to the Acceptance Criteria to be sure that you have defined the definition of “done.”

Create a label called technical debt with a yellow color code and add it to your repository.

Assign labels to your stories. Remember that anything that brings value to the customer is an enhancement, and technical debt can be things that developers need but provide no visible customer value.

Rank the stories in the Product Backlog from highest to lowest priority by dragging them higher or lower in the pipeline column, respectively. Think about the order in which you should implement them.

Click here for a hint.

At least one story should be labeled "technical debt."

Note: If you have added the labels but cannot see them on the kanban board, please follow these steps:
Open the dropdown menu next to the Backlog (highlighted as 1 in the screenshot below).
Click on the arrow next to the Fields option (highlighted as 2).
Drag and drop Labels from the Hidden fields list to the Visible fields list (highlighted as 3).
Click on the Save button to save the changes.

Exercise 7: Build Your First Sprint from Your Product Backlog
In this exercise, you will populate your first Sprint Backlog from your Product Backlog. Typically, you create a sprint plan with your entire team during the sprint planning meeting. But since you are completing this project by yourself, you will have to simulate that meeting.

Steps to complete
Set up three sprints (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3) in GitHub and make the sprints one week in duration.

Open the first story from the top of the Product Backlog and assign estimated story points to it. For now, use the scale 3, 5, 8, 13 = S, M, L, XL.

Assign the current story to Sprint 1.

Close the current story and move it from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog, being careful to preserve its ranked order. For example, the story at the top of the Product Backlog would remain the top story in Sprint Backlog.

Repeat steps 3–5 for the remaining four stories in the Product Backlog, preserving their ranked order.

Ensure each of these stories is "sprint ready" by checking the following:

Each story has a label

Each story has an estimate

Each story is assigned to Sprint 1
